# World Info App

This is my solution to the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

This app was built using the REST Countries API where users can see all the countries from the API on the homepage, search for a country using the input field, click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page and filter countries by region. Axios and the Fetch API were used to fetch and display the data from the API, React Router was used to navigate between pages and the theme toggle switcher was built using Styled Components.

Users can:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
